## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Form Submission Process:**
1. **Frontend**: Form data collected and validated
2. **API Call**: POST to `/api/form-submissions`
3. **Server Processing**: 
   - `saveFormSubmission()` called (legacy compatibility)
   - `saveFormSubmissionExtended()` called automatically
   - Email notifications triggered
4. **Database Storage**: 
   - Legacy table: `form_submissions`
   - New table: `form_submissions_extended`
5. **CMS Integration**: Submissions visible in Forms Manager

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- Legacy API endpoints still work
- Old `form_submissions` table still populated
- Existing integrations unaffected
- Gradual migration to new system possible

Always map all feature dependencies before any change, then isolate and test the exact code section first.
Make one micro-change at a time only, immediately verify the changed feature works, and always retest all mapped dependencies after each change.
Never work on assumptions - if you lack API documentation, configuration details, or any critical information, you must ask clarifying questions.
Working autonomously unless you are blocked and need my approval for missing information or clarification.

# Master Theme Assets

Put **static theme assets** (images, icons, etc.) for the **master** theme here.

They are served at:

- `/theme/master/assets/<file>`

Notes:
- This folder is for **hard-coded** theme assets (checked into the repo).
- For **uploaded** media that lives in the database, use the Media Library (tenant uploads) which typically returns URLs like `/uploads/<tenant-storage>/<file>`.

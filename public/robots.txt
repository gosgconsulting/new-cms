# NOTE: This file is overridden by a dynamic server route at /robots.txt
# The server route serves different content based on deployment type:
# - CMS Admin: Disallows all indexing
# - Theme Deployment: Allows indexing when DEPLOY_THEME_SLUG and CMS_TENANT are set
#
# This static file is only used as a fallback if the server route is not available.

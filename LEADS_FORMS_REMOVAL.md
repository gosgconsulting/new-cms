# 🗑️ Leads & Forms Sections Removal from CMS Sidebar

## 📋 **Changes Made**

### ✅ **Removed from CMSDashboard.tsx:**
1. **Import Statements**: 
   - Removed `FileInput` and `Target` icons from lucide-react
   - Removed `FormsManager` import from '../cms/FormsManager'
   - Removed `LeadsManager` import from './LeadsManager'

2. **Navigation Items**: 
   - Removed `{ id: 'leads', label: 'Leads', icon: Target }` from `crmItems` array
   - Removed `{ id: 'forms', label: 'Forms', icon: FileInput }` from `crmItems` array

3. **Route Cases**: 
   - Removed `case 'leads': return <LeadsManager />;` from `renderContent` function
   - Removed `case 'forms': return <FormsManager />;` from `renderContent` function

### 🗂️ **Files Deleted:**
1. `sparti-cms/components/admin/LeadsManager.tsx` - Duplicate functionality with Contacts
2. `sparti-cms/components/cms/FormsManager.tsx` - Duplicate functionality with Contacts
3. `CONTACT_FORM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Documentation cleanup
4. `REAL_DATA_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation cleanup
5. `FORM_SUBMISSION_FIXED.md` - Documentation cleanup

## 🎯 **Rationale**
- **Leads** functionality was duplicated with **Contacts** - both managed the same form submissions and contact data
- **Forms** functionality was redundant since form submissions are handled through **Contacts**
- Simplifies the UI by removing duplicate navigation options
- Consolidates all contact/lead management into a single **Contacts** section

## 📍 **Current Contact Management**
All contact and form submission functionality is now consolidated under:
- **CMS Dashboard** → **CRM** → **Contacts**

The Contacts section now handles:
- ✅ **Form Submissions**: All contact form submissions from the website
- ✅ **Contact Management**: Creating, editing, and managing contacts
- ✅ **Lead Tracking**: Status management (new, contacted, qualified, converted)
- ✅ **Data Export**: Export functionality for contacts and submissions

## ✅ **Result**
- Cleaner sidebar navigation with no duplicate sections
- Consolidated contact/lead management in one place
- Simplified user experience
- Maintained all functionality while reducing UI complexity
